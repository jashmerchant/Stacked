# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

As a part of CS50W Project-1, I have developed a book-review website named "Stacked" i.e stacked.com
The front-end part of the website is programmed mostly using the Bootstrap Library. I have also used fontawesome.com, and iconscout.com for various icons, used in the website. Additionally I have also used the concept of Flask's flash messages, at various locations, to improve the user-interface.
The images are contained in static folder whereas the html files are contained in template folder. There are a total of 2 images and 6 different html files. In the main folder, where the python files lie, the main file is the application.py, the models.py and createTable.py files are used to create Tables in the Database, and the import.py file is used to store the Books data into the Database.
