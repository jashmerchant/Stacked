# Stacked

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

As a part of CS50W Project-1, I have developed a book-review website named "Stacked".
The front-end part of the website is programmed mostly using the Bootstrap Library. I have also used fontawesome and iconscout for various icons used in this project. Additionally, I have used Flask's flash messages to make the user interface more responsive.
The images are contained in the static folder whereas the HTML files are contained in the template folder. There are a total of 2 images and 6 different HTML files. In the main folder, where the python files lie, the main file is the application.py, the models.py and createTable.py files are used to create Tables in the Database, and the import.py file is used to store the Books data into the Database.
